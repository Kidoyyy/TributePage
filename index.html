    <p>She is a loving mother of four and a hardworking wife. No one compares to the unconditional love she gave to her family. She is the kind of mother who is selfless, genuine, and supportive. She enjoys dancing, singing, and cooks so well. Everyone admires her for her bravery, kindness, friendliness, and compassion. She is my inspiration to work hard and become better every day. To me, she is everything. She often covers her sufferings behind a smile. I've never seen her complain nor gave up. A superwoman indeed.
        As a son, mum is often the first person who inspires and guides you on your way into womanhood. Make sure to let her know how wonderful she is at dealing with boy trouble, being a safe place when things go wrong and putting up with the teenage tantrums!</p>
